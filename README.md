# Webapp Template

[Bookmark](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/)

This is a template for making a Heroku Python/Django app. The goal is to have a working implementation with frontend and backend where functionality can be implemented quickly with a fork.

**Note**: I will only be adding files that I change from the default `django-admin startproject mysite` command, since doing a `git add .` adds the section of code with a secret key.

## Frontend Checklist

- [ ] Form fill buttons
- [ ] Drop-down menu templates
- [ ] Upload text file

## Backend Checklist

- [ ] Parse uploaded text file
- [ ] Parse drop-down menu information
- [ ] Display information on screen
- [ ] Allow user to interact with and change on-screen information
